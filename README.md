# Credit_card_EDA

In this project I've dived deep into the data set which I found on kaggle in order to understand which type of customers are getting attrited. After doing the basic cleaning of the dataset and performing various modeling operations I was able to figure out a certain categories who were dropping out. 
For example it was pretty much visible that the ratio o attrition amongst female customers in genearal was higher as compared to male customers. The second point to observe was that we had a huge customer base for category type of blue card as compared to other product types.
