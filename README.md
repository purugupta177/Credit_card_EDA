# Credit_card_EDA

In this project I've dived deep into the data set which I found on kaggle in order to understand which type of customers are getting attrited from having a crdit card. After doing the basic cleaning of the dataset and performing various modeling operations I was able to figure out a certain categories who were dropping out. 
For example it was pretty much visible that the ratio of attrition amongst female customers in genearal was higher as compared to male customers. The second point to observe was that we had a huge customer base for category type of blue card as compared to other product types. Similarly we can identify from the pivoted and grouped data that the customers having the income range on a lower end were not able to keep up indicating that they were finding it hard to own a credit card. Using the line chart I further concluded that as the number of dependents people of family on the increases the attrition rate goes high as well.  
Further I've made a number of different types of plots like swarm plot, Line chart, Bar graph, Heat maps to easily identify the category of users getting attrited.
